Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear [Bob],

I am writing to you from a [big] spaceship in a [tall] galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a [purple] rocket in [April]. There are [twenty] Shoes and Gloves of Aliens here! In the
Control Room there is a pool full of Orange Juice. I fall asleep each night on a [Amazing] bed of
[Cotton] and dream of [Hiking] [Quickly]. It feels as though I have lived here for
[7] [years]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
[jump] on a [fast] [bus]!!

Best wishes,
[Dhivya]

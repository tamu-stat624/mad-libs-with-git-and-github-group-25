Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear [1],

I am writing to you from a [2] spaceship in a [3] galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a [4] rocket in [5]. There are [6] Shoes and Gloves of Aliens here! In the
Control Room there is a pool full of Orange Juice. I fall asleep each night on a [Amazing] bed of
[Cotton] and dream of [Hiking] [Quickly]. It feels as though I have lived here for
[7] [17]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
[18] on a [19] [20]!!

Best wishes,
[21]
